# Stock-Market-Project
Java Game which simulates the Stock Market

-1 player(input via console amd scanner class)vs 1 stock-trading robot)
-robot and user both start out with $50
-4 stocks to choose from(Yahoo,Google,Disney,Apple)
-Market price adjusts to random events like recession,stock market crash,new president,or war
-Stocks start out priced randomly within a certain range
-user and robot have to buy/sell to make the most profit
-robot uses algorithms to determine when they should buy/sell
-displays current price for each stock
-displays current player's stats as well as conputer's recent activity during the turn
-stats include current money, profit, and each stock which the player has at the present time in a turn
-user types in ….Action……Num of Stocks…...StockName
-Ex: Sell 5 Yahoo          (Yahoo is stock name)
-Computer makes choices soleley dependent on market price(whether or not there is opportunity)
-Users turn is first after random event(start of turn), then robot performs its actions before turn is over
-Fairness is kept for both teams because each team can buy only as much stocks as they’re cash remaining allows(based on previous decisions)
-Winner is announced according to whomever has the larger profit.
