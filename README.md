# Stock-Market-Project
Simulates Stock Market
Ideas;
-Stock Market Game( 1 player vs 1 stock-trading robot)
-4 stocks to choose from
-Market price adjust according to demand and supply of stock
-stocks start out priced randomly and user and robot have to scramble to make the most profit
-buy low sell high
-display current price for each stock
-display robots and players stats
-stats include current money, profit, and each stock which each player/robot has 
-turn based game(10 turns) computer sells/buys then scanner window pops up and it is players turn
-include random events(stock market crash, housing crash,recession,economic boom, Trump war)+ display message
-include random events which change the market price of the stock randomly(every 2 turns)
-Computer(robot) class
-User player class
-user types in ….Action……Num of Stocks…...StockName
-Ex: s 5 Yahoo          (Yahoo is stock name)(s mean sell, b means buy)
-Computer makes choices soleley dependent on market price(whether or not there is opportunity)
-User and robot can buy at most 5 stocks /sell at most 5 stocks of each StockName per turn
-User/robot can buy/sell as many StockName as they want in one turn
-Users turn is first after random event(start of turn), then robot comes in
-User and robot start out with same amount of money
-Its fair for both teams because each team can buy only as much stocks as they’re cash remaining allows(based on previous decisions)
